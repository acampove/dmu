# DecayFiles

## Table with nicknames and event types

The following lines:

```bash
export DECPATH=/home/acampove/Packages/DecFiles

update_decinfo
```

will:

1. Set the path to the [DecFiles](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb-datapkg/Gen/DecFiles)
root directory such that `update_decinfo` can use it.
1. Read the event types and nicknames and save them to a YAML file
